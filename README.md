# Airline-Review-Analysis
The dataset includes customer reviews for 128k+ Airlines.

The objective of this project is to draw useful conclusions from the data that will help you make some significant decisions. We will first analyze the dataset using several methodologies, and if necessary, clean it. Following that, we'll point out the most significant consumer reviews. Finally, we will graphically display the word frequency using "word clouds" or "tag clouds," where the larger the word in the visual, the more frequently that word was used in the customer review.

Thanks for spending time to check this out. I hope you'll enjoy it!
